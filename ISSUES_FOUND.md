# Issues Found with File Upload

## Issue #1: DOM Access Before DOM is Ready (CRITICAL)

**Location:** `main.js` lines 10-23

**Problem:**
The script attempts to access DOM elements immediately at module load time:
```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
const fileInput = document.getElementById('fileInput');
// ... etc
```

When ES6 modules load, they execute immediately - even before the DOM is fully parsed. This means all these `document.getElementById()` calls return `null`, causing the file input event listener to fail silently.

**Symptoms:**
- File input appears to do nothing when clicked
- No console errors (because the event listener is attached to `null`)
- Buttons don't work

**Fix Required:**
Wrap all DOM access in a `DOMContentLoaded` event handler or move it into an initialization function called after DOM is ready.

## Issue #2: Module Script Placement

**Location:** `index.html` - end of file

**Current:**
```html
<script type="module" src="main.js"></script>
```

**Analysis:**
While the script is at the end of the body, ES6 modules are deferred by default but start parsing immediately. The DOM elements being accessed at the top level of main.js may not be available yet.

## Issue #3: No Error Handling for Null Elements

**Problem:**
If DOM elements are `null`, the code doesn't check before adding event listeners. This causes silent failures.

**Example:**
```javascript
fileInput.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
    // This never fires if fileInput is null
});
```

## Summary

**Root Cause:** DOM elements are accessed at module load time before DOM is ready.

**Impact:** Complete failure of all interactive features (file upload, buttons, etc.)

**Priority:** CRITICAL - This prevents the application from functioning at all.
