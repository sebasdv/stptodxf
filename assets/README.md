## Demo STEP Files

To test the application, you can:
1. Create your own STEP files using CAD software (e.g., FreeCAD, Fusion 360)
2. Download sample STEP files from online repositories
3. Use the placeholder geometry that the application generates for testing

Note: The current implementation uses placeholder geometry to demonstrate the viewer functionality. For production use with real STEP files, integrate `occt-import-js` for actual STEP file parsing.
